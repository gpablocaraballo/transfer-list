# transfer-list
Some transfer list left to right and viceversa challenge example using tailwind with react+typescript.

Description:

Given a source of data, fill up the main transfer list component (having left and right container list).
Create a TransfersList component that will handle the entire function.
On clicking of the items on the Left Container, the box should highlight.
On clicking of the items on the Right Container, the box should highlight.
If any of the Arrow Buttons are clicked, the items should move into the respective boxes. For Example, If the First Item from the Left box is moved, it should move to the right box and should be removed from the left box -- finally should be unchecked.
If an item from the left box is moved to left, nothing should happen. Similarly, if an item from the right box is move to right, nothing should happen.
Use tailwindcss for styling.
